# woocommerce-functionality-for-3dPrint-Lite
Good News! Updated Version for 3dPrint Lite 1.8.9.5 is now out!

This is a Wordpress Plugin that gives Woocommerce functionality to the 3dPrint Lite plugin, which does not feature Woocommerce functionality as is. For that, you would need to purchase the premium version that costs $50 USD, so this plugin saves you some money.

<b>Instructions - Very Important</b>
<ol>
  <li>Download the main plugin folder: "woocommerce-functionality-for-3dPrint-Lite.zip".</li>
  <li>Download the <u>Edited</u> 3dPrint Lite Plugin: "3dPrint-lite-EDITED.zip". This file has the email address and comment fields removed, as well as the button that says "Add to cart" rather than "Request a Quote"<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OcJMRYD.png"></li>
  <li>Upload both files to install them onto your Wordpress Site<br><img src="https://www.wonderplugin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Upload-plugin.png"></li>
  <li>Create a new product in Woocommerce and make sure that it is <a href="https://pluginrepublic.com/woocommerce-hidden-products/">hidden</a> (since it won't really be a product on it's own, but this isn't necessary)<br><img src="https://docs.woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/woocommerce-importer-exporter.png"></li>
  <li>Click on the "3DPrint Lite WF" tab in the menu and enter the <b>Product ID</b> of the product that you just created.</li>

  <li>On the page where you have your 3dPrint lite shortcode embedded, add your 3DPLWF shortcode:<br>
    <code>[3dpwf_add_to_cart]</code><br>
    It can be anywhere on the page, but we recommend just above the 3dPrint lite shortcode. Just below is an image of this shortcode in Elementor.</li>
